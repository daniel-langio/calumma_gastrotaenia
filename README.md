Operating System Swarm Control System.

This project is meant for remote control and swarm automatic coordination for a linux operating system (only for ubuntu based system, for now).

## Configuration

### Secrets (don't work for now)
Some sensible information such as database credentials is extracted from `src/main/ressources/secrets.properties`, that you should create before running the application.
As that file is in the `.gitignore` I give an example file, that is `src/main/ressources/example.secrets.properties`.
